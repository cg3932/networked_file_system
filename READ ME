TO RUN:

Step 1: Open 3 seperate terminals
Step 2: In terminal 1 enter: gcc -g -0 nfs_server nfs_server.c sfs_api.c disk_emu.c
Step 3: In terminal 2 enter: ./nfs_server -p 8011 -f disk.dsk
Step 4: In terminal 3 enter: gcc -g -o nfs_test nfs_test.c nfs_client.c
Step 5: In terminal 1 enter: ./nfs_server
Step 6: Verify that in both terminal 1 and 2 the string "waiting for connection" has been printed
Step 7: In terminal 3 enter: ./nfs_test

Notes:

To run the entire test program takes some time, please be patient, I have already confirmed through my own testing that my nfs_client.c and nfs_server.c programs are able to run the test program with 0 errors, please verify this. Thank you.
